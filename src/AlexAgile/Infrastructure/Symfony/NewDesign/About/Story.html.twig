                                <p>During my 15 years career in the tech industry, I have become very aware of the real leadership and collaboration challenges for tech companies.</p>

                                <p>I have been working closely with managers, engineers, and product leaders and I have realized that people with different roles in tech companies speak different languages and that more often than not, they don’t understand each other.</p>

                                <p>I do.</p>

                                <p>The reason I do is that I come from a world where solid principles, domain-driven design, test-driven development, reusability, and scalability were served on a daily.</p>

                                <p>I support managers and employees at all levels to identify what needs to be done and, what is more important, what needs to be stopped to achieve long term positive change.</p>

                                <p>I help organizations and individuals to develop leadership skills that empower people and take the business to the next level.</p>

                                <p>Along these years, I have developed a powerful tool, my “bullshit-meter”. A powerful intuition, supported by deep listening skills, that allows me to hear what is not being said and to really understand what is going on under the surface.</p>

                                <p>I combine my “bullshit-meter” and my “painfully honesty” to help individuals in tech organizations to discover what they do in order to succeed and what they do, unconsciously, to sabotage themselves.</p>

                                <p>I started my career as a software engineer working for multinational companies like Hewlett Packard, Gamelearn, or HomeAdvisor.</p>

                                <p>The same as many of my colleagues, I was focusing exclusively on technical skills.</p>

                                <p>I thought this was not only important but the only thing to focus on. I was even making fun and disrespecting the ones that weren’t doing the same. How narrow was my perspective!</p>

                                <p>
                                    Life put me in front of a team and I soon realized that I had no idea about how to lead people.
                                    <br>
                                    I have the technical knowledge, I was a hard worker and I was coding more and better than ever before, but we weren’t a team. Each of us was working on different things, on different goals, on different worlds.
                                </p>

                                <p>It was eight years ago when I discovered Agile and Scrum.</p>

                                <p>We decided to give a try to Scrum and a miracle happened. We started talking to each other, we started aligning with each other, we started collaborating and having the feeling that we were belonging to something bigger than ourselves.</p>

                                <p>We finally understood why synergy means when the total is bigger than the sum of the parts.</p>

                                <p>I became a Certified Scrum Master and was able to create high-performing and autonomous teams able to multiply their impact by a factor of more than 10 thanks to their commitment and accountability.</p>

                                <p>Then I decided to move forward on my leadership-oriented career and I became a Leadership Coach, helping tech organizations to tackle management and teamwork challenges and taking their business to the next level.</p>

                                <p>Who decides whether or not your products and services are good? Your customers, don’t they?</p>
                                <p>In the same way, who decides whether or not you are good as a leader? The answer is neither you nor your manager. The answer is the people that work with you, at all levels. Your stakeholders are your customers.</p>

                                <p>The Marshall Goldsmith Stakeholder Centered framework that I use works so well that if, at the end of the program there is no positive, measurable change, you don’t pay a dime.</p>
